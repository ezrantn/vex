# Vex

## Overview

Vex is a domain-specific language (DSL) for text processing that is designed to be very simple. It aims for optimal performance, scalability, and maintainability.

My motivation for this project stems from my strong admiration for [awk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html) and [sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html), which are highly effective text processing tools for UNIX. I am working on this project solely for my thesis, and my tool is not intended to replace awk or sed; rather, it aims to provide an alternative solution for text processing on different operating systems.

This project is still under development, and I will soon provide clearer documentation and additional features. For now, you can try out Vex's capabilities.

## Documentation

## License

This tool is open-source and available under the [MIT](https://github.com/ezrantn/vex/blob/main/LICENSE) License.

## Contributions

I kindly request that you do not contribute to this project at this time, as it is part of my thesis, and I want to avoid any potential issues of academic dishonesty. 

However, if you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to reach out to me at [ezrantn@proton.me](mailto:ezrantn@proton.me)
